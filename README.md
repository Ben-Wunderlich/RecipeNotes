# RecipeNotes

This is a chrome extension that lets you add comments to a webpage that will still be there if you ever return. 

## Why did I make this

My mom wanted a way to keep track of the changes she made to recipes she found online, so I wanted to make something to help her do that.

I also use this to keep track of timestamps in videos and other things.

## limitations

It only shows the previous note if it is exactly the same url so if it moved, then when you click the icon it won't show anything. To solve this you can click on "see all notes" to see all of the notes you have made and delete ones you don't need anymore.
